# SQL Server Tutorial: Advanced

## 1. Advanced Query Optimization
- Understanding Query Execution Plans:
  - How to read and interpret execution plans in SSMS.
  - Identifying bottlenecks in queries.
- Index Optimization:
  - When to use clustered and non-clustered indexes.
  - Understanding covering indexes and filtered indexes.
  - Index maintenance: rebuilding and reorganizing.
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs):
  - Writing recursive CTEs.
  - Use cases for complex hierarchical data.
- Window Functions:
  - `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`.
  - Using `PARTITION BY` and `OVER` clauses.

---

## 2. Advanced Transactions and Locking
- Isolation Levels:
  - `READ UNCOMMITTED`, `READ COMMITTED`, `REPEATABLE READ`, `SERIALIZABLE`, and `SNAPSHOT`.
  - Choosing the right isolation level for performance and consistency.
- Deadlock Management:
  - Understanding how deadlocks occur.
  - Strategies to avoid and resolve deadlocks.
- Advanced Transaction Control:
  - Savepoints within transactions:
    ```sql
    SAVE TRANSACTION SavePointName;
    ROLLBACK TRANSACTION SavePointName;
    ```

---

## 3. Advanced Error Handling
- Nested `TRY...CATCH` Blocks:
  - Handling errors at multiple levels.
  - Logging errors to a table.
- Using `THROW` for Re-Throwing Errors:
  ```sql
  BEGIN TRY
      -- Code that might fail
  END TRY
  BEGIN CATCH
      THROW;
  END CATCH;
  ```
- Creating Custom Error Messages:
  - Using `sp_addmessage` and `RAISERROR`.

---

## 4. Advanced Stored Procedures
- Dynamic SQL in Stored Procedures:
  - Building and executing dynamic queries with `EXEC()` or `sp_executesql`.
- Optimizing Stored Procedures:
  - Using `WITH RECOMPILE` to avoid parameter sniffing.
  - Avoiding recompilation overhead with proper indexing.
- Handling Multiple Result Sets in Procedures.

---

## 5. Advanced Functions
- Table-Valued Functions:
  - Inline and multi-statement table-valued functions.
  - Performance considerations.
- System Catalog Functions:
  - Querying metadata using functions like `OBJECT_ID`, `COL_LENGTH`, and `DB_NAME`.
- Advanced String Manipulations:
  - Parsing JSON with `OPENJSON`.
  - Using `STRING_AGG` for concatenating values.

---

## 6. Advanced Views
- Indexed Views:
  - Creating and maintaining indexed views.
  - Performance benefits and limitations.
- Materialized Views (Alternative):
  - Strategies for mimicking materialized views in SQL Server.
- Updating Data Through Views:
  - Rules and restrictions when modifying data using views.

---

## 7. SQL Server Integration with Other Tools
- SQL Server and .NET Integration:
  - Using SQLCLR to write custom logic in .NET and integrate with SQL Server.
- SQL Server and Power BI:
  - Querying and optimizing data sources for Power BI.
- SQL Server and Python/R:
  - Executing Python and R scripts using SQL Server Machine Learning Services.

---

## 8. Partitioning and Sharding
- Table Partitioning:
  - Partitioned tables for managing large datasets.
  - Using `CREATE PARTITION FUNCTION` and `CREATE PARTITION SCHEME`.
- Database Sharding:
  - Concepts and best practices.
  - Implementing sharding for horizontal scaling.

---

## 9. Advanced Security
- Dynamic Data Masking:
  - Masking sensitive data for non-privileged users.
- Row-Level Security:
  - Restricting access to rows based on user roles.
- Transparent Data Encryption (TDE):
  - Enabling TDE to secure data at rest.
- Always Encrypted:
  - Protecting sensitive data with Always Encrypted.

---

## 10. Advanced Backup and Recovery
- Point-In-Time Recovery:
  - Using transaction log backups for restoring to a specific time.
- Database Snapshots:
  - Creating snapshots for quick recovery scenarios.
- Managing High Availability:
  - Log shipping, replication, and SQL Server Always On Availability Groups.

---

## 11. Performance Monitoring and Tuning
- Monitoring Tools:
  - Using SQL Server Profiler and Extended Events.
  - Tracking query performance with `sys.dm_exec_query_stats`.
- Query Hints:
  - Forcing join orders and index usage with hints like `OPTION (FORCE ORDER)`.
- Memory Optimization:
  - In-Memory OLTP tables for high-performance transactions.

---

## 12. Practical Use Cases
- Implementing Audit Trails:
  - Tracking changes to data with triggers and audit tables.
- Real-Time Analytics:
  - Using indexed views and partition switching for near real-time reporting.
- Challenges:
  - Create a stored procedure for monthly sales reporting with error handling.
  - Optimize a query that processes millions of rows for a data warehouse.
